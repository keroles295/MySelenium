Selenium:

Why do we need Xpath and Css Selector?
---developers may not provide all the locators in html
---By using xpath and Css we can identify elements with any given attributes
What is an Xpath?
---It is a like a query language which helps us to identify elements uniquely on the web page.
Types of Xpath:
---Absoulute Xpath--->it starts from the starting node of the html
    it always starts from the single (/)
    e.g/html/body/div
---The Relative Xpath--->It starts from any node in html
    it always starts with double //
    the Syntax for relative xpath is:
    //tagename[@attribute='attribute value']
Identifying elements by its text:
  //tagname[text() ='textvalue']
  e.g //a[text() ='Create new account']
  e.g //h2[text() ='Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']
Identify elements by its contains method:
  //tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
  //input[contains(@placeholder, 'or phone')]
  //h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]
Starts -with will identify elements by its partial starting value
  //tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting value')]
  e.g //input[starts-with(@data-testid, 'royal')]
  e.g //input[starts-with(@aria-label, 'Email')]
ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

Advanced Xpath :
  is based on parent and child, sibling relationships:
  identify element by following sibling
  //tagname[@attribute='attribute']/following-sibling::siblingtagname
  e.g //input[@id='calFromDate']/following-sibling::img
  //label[@for = 'leaveList_calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

  identify element by precceding siblings
  //tagname[@attribute='attribute']/preceding-sibling::siblingtagname
  //span[text()='& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

  identify element by its parent:
  //tagname[@attribute='attributeva']/parent::parenttagname
  //span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

  identifying elements by its ancestors:
  //input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

  identify elements by its index:
  (//tagename[@attribute='attribute value'])[index]
  (//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
